This is a set of experimental classes for computer graphics. The main set pieces are:

* `PixieCanvas` which is useful to draw on a unit canvas (it's useful for plotting and drawing pictures in a plane)
* `Turtle` which is a very basic turtle graphics class.

Both implementations are very much in sandboxing/experimental stage. Use at own risk.
