# Pixie
This is a rewrite of the original **Pixie** which was an implementation of the
ray-tracer described in the excellent [The Ray-Tracer Challenge](http://#) book 
by **Jamis Buck**. This is a complete rewrite that is based on 
`System.Numerics` for multiple reasons:
1. People much smarter than me have already supplied the matrix math stuff.
2. There's also the opportunity to dip into generic math.
3. It is a (somewhat) stable and well documented interface.
